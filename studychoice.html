    <h1>Why HBO-ICT?</h1>
    <p>
        The most important question to ask myself is why? Why HBO? Why ICT? Why am I here on the HZ?<br>
        But what is my motivation behind everything? What's my motivation to study HBO-ICT on HZ in Middelburg?
        To find out what my intrinsic motivation is, I've to ask myself lots of why's. So let's start with it!<br>
        <br>
        <b>Why did I choose for ICT?</b><br>
        I choose for ICT because I always liked play games and<br>
        I was curious about how the pc works and why.<br><br>
        <b>Why do I want to know about pc's?</b><br>
        I want to know about pc's because<br>
        I want to understand what I'm working with<br><br>
        <b>Why do I want to understand working with pc's?</b><br>
        It makes me feel less helpless when<br>
        a simple bug pops on the screen<br><br>
        <b>Why don't I want to feel helpless?</b><br>
        I don't want to feel helpless because<br>
        I like to have everything in my control.<br>
        It makes me comfortable knowing I have control over the situation.<br>
        Generally I am just curious about how a pc works.<br><br>
