        Since I was little I always played games. I played different kind of games. <br>
        When I was younger I always wanted to become a veterinarian. When I went to secondary school I did "VWO"<br>
        VWO is called preparatory scientific education. I did that for three years.<br>
        I figured out that I didn't want to study all the time so I made my choice to go to "HAVO".<br>
        Becoming a veterinarian is a long road. I was too lazy to walk that one so I wanted to become an IT
        specialist.<br>
        For the study HBO-ICT I didn't need a "VWO" diploma. So I could do "HAVO". I had more time to sport.<br>
        Honestly I wanted to know how computers work. I find it fascinating and I want to know what is behind the
        screens.<br>
        You can read more about my motivation in blog '<a href="studychoice.html">Study choice</a>'

        <img src="Images/goese-lyceum.jpg" alt="school" style="position: absolute; right: 80px; top: 350px;">

        The first three years I did preparatory scientific education.<br>
        I decided to do higher general continued education also called "HAVO".<br>
